''' TODO list
 - add reprs for types
 - agents need to be able to specify the amount of workers they take when producing (maybe use choose_numeric for now)
 - make sure all actions have the right level of optionality
 - implement NumericChoice actions
 - redo DiscreteChoice actions to be more specific
 - all of the faction abilities
  - Polania gets 2 encounters per card
 - encounter cards
 - factory cards
 - secret objectives
 - stringify everything
 - logging
 - random agent
