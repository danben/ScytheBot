# 1. Choose a piece to move from pieces that haven't moved this turn. Only now do we know how much move we can have.
# 2. For each point of movement you have the option to:
# 2a. Load as much stuff as you want (look at everything in your current square that's carryable by your piece type)
# 2b. Move to an adjacent hex
# 2bi. Update the new and old hexes for the piece being moved as well as each piece being carried.
# 2biii. Mark the piece as having moved this turn.
# 2c. Drop all your stuff
